    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->

    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed as an "Onboarding AI Assistant" to guide HR professionals. The structure prioritizes a non-linear, task-oriented exploration over a linear document review. The core is an interactive timeline of the onboarding journey (Pre-board, Day 1, etc.). Clicking a phase reveals suitable interactive techniques (as cards) for that stage. Clicking a technique card opens a modal with details (description, tools, benefits). This layered approach makes the dense report digestible and actionable. It's supported by secondary sections with interactive charts for benefits and clickable tags for key concepts, allowing users to explore foundational knowledge on demand. This structure was chosen to be "meta" – an interactive tool to learn about building interactive experiences, enhancing user engagement and understanding. -->

    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 

        1. Report Info: Onboarding Journey Phases. Goal: Organize & Explore. Viz: Interactive tabs/buttons for each phase. Interaction: Click to filter a grid of "technique cards". Justification: Breaks down the report's core into a manageable, two-level interactive experience. Library: JS DOM manipulation.

        2. Report Info: Benefits & Stats (e.g., 82% retention). Goal: Inform & Compare. Viz: Horizontal bar chart. Interaction: Hover for tooltips with specific stats. Justification: More impactful than a list; interactivity adds engagement. Library: Chart.js.

        3. Report Info: Interactive Techniques (Gamification, VR, etc.). Goal: Inform & Organize. Viz: Grid of cards. Interaction: Click to open a modal with details. Justification: Standard, scannable UI for a collection of items; modals allow deep dives without context switching. Library: JS DOM manipulation.

        4. Report Info: Measuring Success. Goal: Inform. Viz: Flippable cards for each metric. Interaction: Click/hover to "flip" the card and reveal details. Justification: A novel interaction to make statistical information more engaging. Library: HTML/CSS/JS.
